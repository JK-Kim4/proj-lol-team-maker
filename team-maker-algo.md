서로 다른 점수의 10명의 플레이어를 2개의 팀으로 나누는 방법 (ChatGPT)


There are several algorithms you can use to create two teams with 10 players who have each rating. One such algorithm is the "balanced partition" algorithm, which works as follows:

Sort the players by rating in descending order.
Create two empty teams, Team A and Team B.
Starting with the highest-rated player, add players to Team A and Team B alternately until all players have been assigned to a team.
This algorithm will ensure that the overall ratings of the two teams are as similar as possible, since the highest-rated players will be distributed evenly between the teams.

Another algorithm you can use is the "minimax" algorithm. This algorithm works as follows:

Sort the players by rating in descending order.
Create two empty teams, Team A and Team B.
Starting with the highest-rated player, calculate the difference in ratings between that player and the current worst player in Team A. Then do the same with Team B.
Add the player to the team where the difference in ratings is the smallest.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all players have been assigned to a team.
This algorithm will ensure that the difference in ratings between the two teams is minimized, resulting in a fair and balanced game.

You can pick any of them and tweak it according to your need.
